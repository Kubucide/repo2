## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Divs, paragraphs, and Flexboxes


### What I learned

The main thing I Recapped/learned during this project is the ease of using **Flexbox** for code formatting. it's also easier to resize compared to Grid since this design structure is mostly one-dimensional.


```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more on **FlexBox** and **Grid** as they are very essential in code formatting and saves a lot time/stress in arranging codes manually.

### Useful resources

- [chat.openai.com)](chat.openai.com) - This mostly helped me with easier codes when i get stuck with codes or not getting enough insight
- [supersimple.dev](supersimple.dev) - This online tutor really helped me get started in my web dev journey. He makes coding super easy just as his suggests.
